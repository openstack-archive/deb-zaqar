features:
  - Currently Zaqar can support more built-in/reserved attributes in queue.
    For now there are two important attributes 'max_messages_post_size' and
    'max_message_ttl'. With this feature, when user query queues Zaqar will show
    those two attributes (read from config file if there is no customized value
    from user) in queue metadata so that user can know what value it is.
