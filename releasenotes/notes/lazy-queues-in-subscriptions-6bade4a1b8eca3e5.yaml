features:
  - Queues now behave lazy in subscriptions also. So there is no need for
    the user to pre-create a queue before creating a subscription for this
    queue. Zaqar will create the queue automatically on the subscription
    creation request. As before, all subscriptions will continue to stay
    active even if the corresponding queue was deleted.
