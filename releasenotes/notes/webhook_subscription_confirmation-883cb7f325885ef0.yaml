features:
  - Now before users send messages to subscribers through a queue, the
    subscribers should be confirmed first. Zaqar only sends messages to the
    confirmed subscribers. This feature supports "webhook" and "mailto"
    subscribers with mongoDB or redis backend. The "mailto" part will be done
    in O cycle. Set "require_confirmation = True" to enable this feature. The
    default value is "False" now and we will enable it by default after one or
    two cycles.
