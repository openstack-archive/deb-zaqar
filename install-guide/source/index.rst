The Messaging service is multi-tenant, fast, reliable, and scalable. It allows
developers to share data between distributed application components performing
different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component to be
always available.

The service features a RESTful API and a Websocket API, which developers can
use to send messages between various components of their SaaS and mobile
applications, by using a variety of communication patterns.

This chapter assumes a working setup of OpenStack following the base
Installation Guide.
