Code reviews with Gerrit
========================

Zaqar uses the `Gerrit`_ tool to review proposed code changes. The review site
is http://review.openstack.org.

Gerrit is a complete replacement for GitHub pull requests. `All GitHub pull
requests to the Zaqar repository will be ignored`.

See `Development Workflow with Gerrit`_ for more detailed documentation on how
to work with Gerrit.
