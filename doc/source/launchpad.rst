`Launchpad`_ hosts the Zaqar project. The Zaqar project homepage on Launchpad is

Launchpad credentials
---------------------

Creating a login on Launchpad is important even if you don't use the Launchpad
site itself, since Launchpad credentials are used for logging in on several
OpenStack-related sites. These sites include:

 * `Wiki`_
 * Gerrit (see :doc:`gerrit`)
 * Jenkins (see :doc:`jenkins`)

The developers mailing list address is ``openstack-dev@lists.openstack.org``.
This is a common mailing list across all OpenStack projects.

Technical support (Answers)
---------------------------

Zaqar Answers page is at https://answers.launchpad.net/zaqar.

Note that `Ask OpenStack`_ (which is not hosted on Launchpad) can also be used
for technical support requests.
